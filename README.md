# vitals

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## ❤️Inspiration
Corona made us realize the importance of health and fitness. People were unorganized about their prescriptions and reports. We thought to bring the revolution in the domain of health. Therefore we not just made an app but we are bringing Vital+ as a mission towards health, peace and fitness.
## ✨What it does
It brings all health and fitness tools at one platform by not just giving Pedometer details but also bringing a whole new range of personalized yogas and endemic details.
User can share his medical records to his near ones.
Also used AR/VR to demonstrate yogas.
Also sending personalised yogas based on age, health and other details.
Using Twilio api to send suggested yogas and diseases using user's current location.
##👶 How we built it
We built it using **Flutter** for front end of app, **Firebase** as backend tool, **Flask** for integrating python and html form, **Unity** was used for 3D models and demonstrations. **Twilio** api was used to send personalized yogas.
##🎶 Challenges we ran into
Integrating all platforms together was a lot more difficult than we thought.
##🕯️ Accomplishments that we're proud of
We brought good health mission on one platform and we were able to complete the app within given time framework.
## 🔔What we learned
We learned to do teamwork and integrate all tools and platforms together.
